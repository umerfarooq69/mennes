                                3. Mennes Digital Ads Management (with Mennes Digital management fees) is a separate
                                service from any and all fees that Facebook will charge the Client. The Client will pay
                                these fees directly to Facebook. Cancellation of the Client’s Mennes Digital Facebook
                                Ads management does not automatically stop the Client’s Facebook advertising from
                                running and incurring Facebook Ads fees. Mennes Digital will not be liable for any
                                amounts that Facebook Ads charges the Client following the cancellation of the Client’s
                                management with Mennes Digital. If the Client wishes to cease advertising online at the
                                same time that the Client cancels its Mennes Digital management, please notify your
                                Client Manager in writing so that Mennes Digital can cancel the Client’s Facebook Ads
                                online advertising as well. Alternatively, the Client may choose to directly access its
                                own Facebook Ads account to arrange cancellation.<br>
                                4. For clarity, please note that Mennes Digital is not Facebook, Facebook Business or
                                Facebook Ads Manager as Mennes Digital is a separate entity from Facebook.<br>
                                5. Mennes Digital will endeavour to help the Client obtain the Client’s online Facebook
                                advertising goals by providing the Client with advice, information and technical
                                services in relation to Facebook advertising/marketing. Unless specifically stated to
                                the contrary in this Agreement, Mennes Digital does not guarantee any particular rate of

                                Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving each other 30 days’ written (or
                                electronic mail) notice after the expiry of the Minimum Term from the Agreement Date.
                                Termination for Cause
                                Either party to this Agreement may terminate the Agreement if the other party defaults
                                in the performance of any of its material duties and obligations and the default is not
                                cured within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice of said default, or if the
                                default is not reasonably curable within said period of time unless the defaulting party
                                commences cure within said period of time and diligently proceeds to cure the default.
                                Any non-cancelable materials, services, etc., Mennes Digital has properly committed
                                itself to purchase for the Client’s account, (either specifically or as part of a plan
                                such as modules, photography and/or external services) shall be paid for by the Client,
                                in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Mennes Digital agrees to use the
                                best efforts to minimise such liabilities immediately upon written notification from the
                                Client. Mennes Digital will provide written proof, upon request of the Client, that any
                                such materials and services are non-cancelable.<br>
                                11.3 Materials Unpaid For
                                If upon termination there exist any materials furnished by Mennes Digital or any
                                services performed by Mennes Digital for which the Client has not paid Mennes Digital in
                                full, until such time as the Client has paid Mennes Digital in full, the Client agrees
                                not to use any such materials, in whole or in part, or the product of such services.<br>
                                11.4 Transfer of Materials<br>
                                Upon termination of this agreement, provided that there is no outstanding indebtedness
                                then owing by the Client to Mennes Digital, Mennes Digital shall transfer, assign and
                                make available to the Client all property and materials in its possession or control
                                belonging to the Client. The Client agrees to pay for all costs associated with the
                                transfer of materials.<br>
                                11.5 Refund Policy & Consequential Loss<br>
                                To the extent permitted by law and subject to any consumer guarantees the Client has
                                under the United Kingdom Consumer Law, the parties agree that neither party shall be
                                liable to the other for or in relation to any consequential loss (which includes but is
                                not limited to loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunities, loss of
                                anticipated business opportunities, loss of anticipated savings and damage to goodwill)
                                which relate to the obligations of the parties or arising from a breach by either party

                                Except as otherwise set forth or referred to in this Agreement, this Agreement
                                constitutes the sole and entire Agreement and understanding between the parties hereto
                                as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and
                                understandings of every kind and nature between them as to such subject matter. <br>
                                If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
                                under any present or future law, then that provision will be fully severable. In such
                                instance, this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or
                                unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining
                                provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
